     -Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?
    </p>

    <p>
     I haven't tried any of the techniques. I read the articles and watched the videos.

     I have books on the related subjects and also have tried various apps like headspace. My favourite app is one with 'relief sounds' I can put the sounds on in my noise cancelling headphones and zone out. If I need to concentrate I will do this too.

     I also have a habit app on the phone which is also useful. Creating visions and objectives along the way to reach the vision is helpful... Small incremental steps.

     -What did you find interesting?
    </p>

    <p>
     Habits, mindfulness and NLP are interesting, I have a few books on my kindle. They cover some of the topics in the links. They all have their merits and is down to what works for you at that time, to keep you interested in achieving the objective.

     -What worked for you?
    </p>

    <p>
      As above they all have their merits, I like to think of what was the trigger to action, what was the thing that made me perform an action. I think of it as the final 5%, the thing that pushes me out of the door to the gym. 

      Focusing on this study is because we have a deadline, it is the same in the workplace, I won't have that desire to perform the action without an objective/deadline.

      Reading books and articles can be inspiring enough to be a call to action to make me perform that action or activity to get the objective moving or completed.

    <p>
    -Which will you experiment further with?
    </p>

    <p>
    The app on the phone is working best for me, I would call it a kind of mindfulness, zoning out and then fading back into the activity at hand.

    Physical activity like the gym and removing distractions like twitter and facebook is absolutely key. The point about not being bored resonated too.
