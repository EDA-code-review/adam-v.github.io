-What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?

<br> Early days and working remotely I don't have much of an opinion, I am trying to focus on focusing! and actually sitting down and learning. 

<br>-What are your impressions? 

<br> Mainly bad impressions of famous people. Seriously, as previous question I am immersing myself in trying to learn the tutorials and haven't really formed any impressions about the course apart from deep end!!


<br>-How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
<br>Could be interesting, learning new skills, new soft skills in more of a team environment from the past may be challenging at times but keen to make (have taken) the jump.


<br>-Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

<br> As top 2 questions remotely working I don't think I had any preconceptions as I knew I would have to make a jump. I am glad I got stuck in and made the jump. 

<br>-Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
<br>As above I am super keen but apprehensive as it is a total tilt in mindset and learning / training the brain on habits and new material.
